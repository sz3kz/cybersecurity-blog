# My Cyber Blog
**What's up!** Welcome to my cybersecurity blog!
## whoami
I'm just your run-of-the-mill computer enthusiast. Switching from a Windows to Linux has opened my eyes to the wonderful world of computers. Currently I take great interest in how computers work on a low level, and currently also dable with cybersecurity topics.

This is me <sub>(not really)</sub>.
## Purpose of this blog
This is the place where I will be posting my walkthroughs of various Capture The Flag exercises on the internet. After a bit of time I plan to accumulate a large collection of writeups of machines touching on various topics. 

This will be a chance for me to deep-dive into the misconfigurations that are to be leveraged to own a system. I will also be able to use this opportunity to refine my enumeration methodology by reading writeups of others and posting my findings.

Kudos to [Inching Towards Intelligence](https://medium.com/@Inching-Towards-Intelligence/reflections-on-grinding-through-100-ctf-writeups-a61ce4095d7a) for inspiring me to start this blog.
## Style of blogs
Whether you dived deep into probability or not - you've probably heard about the counter-intuitive [Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem), stating that if a monkey was given a typewriter and an infinite amount of time, the random sequences of letters from the writing of the monkey would compose every literary work known to man, even that of Shakespeare. 

I believe that this phenomenom can be observed in every area of life, even in cybersecurity. When doing CTFs, I often combine switches randomly, without understanding how the tool works. I sometimes even try to brute-force the options to get the output I see in a writeup, which defeats the purpose of doing a CTF ( brute-forcing a bruteforce is a mouth-full and _not very bussiness_ of me). 

Through this blog, I look forward to taking time to understand the tools I use, while not feeling like I am wasting time. I picture my writeups to explain previously-foreign-to-me concepts in _[layman's terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_English)_, and if the subject is a rabbit-hole **too** deep to examine - I'll make sure to admit my lack of knowledge in order to know what needs refining.

This way, I believe I (and any other monkey reading) will be able to write *sz3kz*peare in a reasonable amount of time!
