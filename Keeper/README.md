# Keeper
**Keeper** is an Easy HackTheBox machine. It hosts a ticket website set up without changing default credentials. After a bit of looking, ssh credentials for a normal user can be found. SSHing into the machine reveals a zip file containing a dump of a vulnerable KeePass application, allowing us to recover the key for the database. In the database the root's putty ssh key file, which after translating into OpenSSH format gives us root access to the machine.
